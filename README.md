This is a silly little project that was born of necessity, as I realized how annoying it is to try and import photos on mac from a proper camera
This current build features : 
- Implemented main App component with file upload feature.
- Added filtering options for JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and RAW formats (Canon, Nikon, Sony).
- Integrated JSZip for creating downloadable ZIP files of filtered images.
- basic styling in App.css.
- Configured .gitignore to exclude node_modules and build files.
